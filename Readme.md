# Marana (Market Technical Analytics and Trading)

Marana is a cross-platform project written in C#/Mono designed to allow retail investors to use technical analysis of market assets in order to inform and conduct market trading, using the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) and [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) platforms for market data and [Skender.Stock.Indicators](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators) for analytics and metrics. Marana stores and handles cached and calculated data using a MySQL database. Using SQL queries and instruction sets that can be developed by the user and stored in the MySQL database, Marana can execute automated trades using the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) trading platform.

Since Marana is comprised of free and/or open source software, this allows retail investors to conduct technical analysis of data with minimal financial barriers to entry.

## Instructions for Use (As of [version 0.3.0](https://github.com/tanjera/marana/tree/bdac8ae9d76866f18e600cd92a53f592cef51d43))
Although Marana aims to reduce barriers to data analysis for retail investors, **using Marana still requires a fair amount of computing skills, especially writing database queries** including a minimum ability to use the command prompt, install a MySQL database service, and be able to write basic SQL (database) queries. Although using Marana and its connected services are all free, it is not a turnkey operation.

### 1) Install a [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   1) The server does not have to be on the same computer that will be running Marana, though it is recommended to be on a LAN or high-speed connection due to speed constraints
   2) It is recommended to use a graphical/GUI interface such as [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) (standalone tool, cross-platform) or [phpMyAdmin](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/) (requires web server)

### 2) Configure the MySQL Server
   1) Marana requires a database user and password (example username 'marana') to log in to the MySQL server
      1) Note: Marana will store this password *unencrypted* in your user's `~/.config/Marana` (Linux) or `...\AppData\Roaming\Marana` (Windows) folder (*not* on the database); *it is recommended to use a [randomly generated password](https://www.google.com/search?q=random+password+generator)* for your Marana database user account!!
   2) Marana requires a database schema (database object) that its user has privileges for (requires Object Rights and DDL Rights)
   3) For more information on initial setup of a MySQL server, including obtaining root access, see the official MySQL documentation: ["Getting Started with MySQL"](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql-getting-started/en/)
   ![image](docs/workbench_user.png)
   *"Schema" and "Users and Privileges" view in [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)*

### 3) Initial Setup: Run Marana (`marana.exe`) and select "Settings" > "Edit"   
   1) If your [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) account uses a Paper (fake money) account, then you must enter the Paper credentials.
   ![image](docs/gui_settings.png)
   *Editing and viewing user settings from the graphical user interface*
   
### 4) Use Marana to Obtain Data: Run a Library Update
   1) Marana can be operated from the command-line graphical user interface, or accept arguments from the command line.
   2) Running `marana.exe library update` from the command line will download data from Alpaca, run analyses, and store the data on the database server.
   ![image](docs/cli_libraryupdate.png)
   *`marana.exe library update`*
   1) For regular data updates, you can create tasks to run `marana.exe library update` via the [Task Scheduler](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/taskschd/about-the-task-scheduler) (Windows) or [cron jobs](https://www.google.com/search?q=linux+cron+task) (Linux)
   2) If you forget the list of command-line arguments, you can run `marana.exe help`
   ![image](docs/cli_commands.png)
   *`marana.exe help`*

### 5) Access Marana's Data Library
   1) Accessing Marana's MySQL database directly allows you to run queries directly against raw market data, which is useful for:
      1) Screening stocks based on specific values and indicators
      2) Selecting stocks for further research
      3) Developing queries to function as entry and exit queries for automated strategies
   2) Some sample queries include:
      1) Selecting all stocks whose [Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/macd.asp) is over the MACD Signal
         ```
         SELECT             
            today.Symbol,
            today.Date,            
            today.MACD,
            today.MACD_Signal
         FROM
            Marana.Daily today
         WHERE            
            today.Date = CURDATE()
            AND today.MACD > today.MACD_Signal               
         ;
         ```
      2) Selecting all stocks whose [Stochastic Oscillator](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stochasticoscillator.asp) is under 25, a common signal to buy.
         ```
         SELECT             
            today.Symbol,
            today.Date,
            today.Stochastic_Oscillator
         FROM
            Marana.Daily today
         WHERE            
            today.Date = CURDATE()
            AND today.Stochastic_Oscillator < 25               
         ;
         ```

### 7) Using Automated Trading (Live and Paper)   
   1) Insert strategies (custom SQL queries) into the MySQL database's `Strategies` table
      1) The `Strategies` table is automatically created when Marana accesses the database (e.g. for library updates)
         1) If the table is not present, retrieving library information (`Main Menu > Library > Information`) will create the empty table.
      2) **Writing strategy queries:** A strategy query needs to return _a row_ if the conditions are met, and return _no_ data if conditions are not met.
      3) Marana interprets several values, making strategies useful for different symbols and for daily use. Interpreted values are:
         1) `{SYMBOL}` allows Marana to use the query against different symbols, e.g. AAPL or MSFT
         2) `{DATE}` allows Marana to set the date of the query day by day
      4) An example of a valid strategy query:
         ```
         SELECT *
         FROM Marana.Daily today
         WHERE
            today.Symbol = '{SYMBOL}'
            AND today.Date = '{DATE}'
            AND today.Stochastic_Oscillator < 25               
         ;
         ```
      5) Strategies consist of the following fields:
         1) `Name` is a unique (cannot be repeated) name for the Strategy
         2) `Entry` is the SQL query to be triggered to initiate buying the asset
         3) `ExitGain` is the SQL query to be triggered to initiate selling the asset (to obtain gain)
         4) `ExitStopLoss` is the SQL query to be triggered to intiate sellign the asset (to stop loss)
      6) An example of strategy queries entered into the `Strategies` table.
         ![image](docs/workbench_strategies.png)
         *Sample `Strategies` table as seen in [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)*
      7) Validate that Marana can execute the strategy queries without any errors or issues; (`Main Menu > Strategies > Test Queries`)
         ![image](docs/gui_testqueries.png)
         *Testing strategies for validity in Marana*
   2) Insert automated trading instructions (each row of data is one automated trading instruction) into the MySQL database's `Instructions` table
      1) The `Instructions` table is automatically created when Marana accesses the database (e.g. for library updates)
         1) If the table is not present, retrieving library information (`Main Menu > Library > Information`) will create the empty table.
      2) Automated instructions are self explanatory. For clarity:
         1) `ID` is a unique number (cannot be repeated)- it is auto-generated if not entered.
         2) `Name` can be any description for the instruction- it can be left blank, named after the symbol, etc.
         3) `Active` is a boolean (true/false) flag of whether to run or skip the instruction.
         4) `Format` is either 'Paper' or 'Live', specifies whether to use the Paper account or Live trading account.
         5) `Symbol` is the ticker symbol to be queried and traded.
         6) `Strategy` is the Strategy's `Name` to use for detecting buy signals (`Entry` query) and sell signals (`ExitGain`, `ExitLoss` queries)
         7) `Quantity` is the amount of shares to purchase (e.g. stock shares)
         8) `Frequency` is the frequency this instruction is expected to be queried at (currently only 'Daily')
      3) **Note:** It is recommended to only have one instruction per symbol. Having multiple instructions acting on one symbol _will_ produce unwanted results.
      4) An example of instructions entered into the `Instructions` table.
         ![image](docs/workbench_instructions.png)
         *Sample `Instructions` table as seen in [MySQL Workbench](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/)*
   3) Run the automated trading functions (command line `marana.exe execute all` or `execute live` or `execute paper`)
      1) Automated trading instructions are run with the following actions and safeguards taking place:
         1) Marana ensures the latest market data is present in the data library (for estimating costs of buy orders)
         2) Current open orders are checked to prevent duplicate orders from being placed
         3) Current positions are checked to prevent "stacking" buy orders on top of current positions
         4) Current positions are checked to prevent selling of shares without currently owning them
            1) The Alpaca API would interpret this as placing a short sale order
         5) Current available cash is checked in the account; estimated cost of open buy orders is subtracted from this
            1) Ensuring available cash is present- and not earmarked to open buy orders- prevents buying on margin
