# Marana (Market Technical Analytics and Trading)

Marana is a cross-platform program written in C#/Mono designed to allow retail investors to use technical analysis of market assets in order to inform and conduct market trading, using the [Alpaca](https://alpaca.markets/) platform for market data and [Skender.Stock.Indicators](https://github.com/DaveSkender/Stock.Indicators) for analytics and metrics. Additionally, Marana uses a MySQL database for its storage and handling of data. Since Marana is comprised of free and/or open source software, this allows retail investors to conduct technical analysis of data with minimal financial barriers to entry.
